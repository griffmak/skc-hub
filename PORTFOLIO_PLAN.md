# moomoo × Mets Campaign Playbook Site — Implementation Plan
**For: Griffin Maklansky | Target role: Junior Brand Marketing Specialist - Sports**

---

## Concept

Not a portfolio. A **campaign strategy microsite** that shows moomoo exactly what
Griffin would do in the role — presented as a 2026 Mets season campaign playbook.

**Title:** "From Bullpen to Bull Market: A 2026 Season Campaign Playbook"
**Subtitle:** "A brand strategy proposal for moomoo's New York Mets partnership | Griffin Maklansky"

The site IS the work sample. It demonstrates:
- Deep research into moomoo's brand + the existing Mets partnership
- Original campaign concepts built on real data
- Social content strategy + influencer framework
- Measurement/KPI thinking
- Why Griffin is the right person to execute it

---

## Research Findings (fuel for the site content)

### The Existing Partnership (announced April 3, 2025)
- Official multiyear, multimillion-dollar sponsorship
- 36-ft double-sided digital display at Citi Field
- **"Moomoo Mondays"** — 500+ free tickets per Monday home game for moomoo users
- **Win Fund** — $10,000 added per Mets win; $1M grand prize if Mets hit 100 wins
- **Edwin Diaz commercial** — "From bullpen to bull market, moomoo, your powerful trading platform"
- 80 home games/season × 38,603 avg attendance = 3M+ annual touchpoints

### The Target Audience
- Mets fan avg household income: $56,397 (35% above NYC average)
- 39% of attendees from NYC five boroughs, 26% from Long Island
- MLB avg fan age dropped from 51 → 45 (2019–2024) — younger fans emerging
- moomoo has 25M+ global users; the Mets deal is their NYC acquisition engine

### The Opportunity Gap
The existing activations (Moomoo Mondays, Win Fund, Diaz commercial) are
**awareness plays**. The 2026 campaign layer should focus on **conversion** —
turning curious fans into moomoo users through content, community, and
in-stadium experiences that make investing feel as natural as baseball.

### Comparable Fintech Sports Playbooks
- Robinhood: front-of-shirt sponsor of OGC Nice (2025/26), NBA (Heat, Grizzlies, Wizards)
- Revolut: Audi F1 title sponsor (2026), first neobank in esports
- moomoo's "Trade Smart" OOH campaign reached 3.4M NYC commuters (Dec 2025)

## Page Sections (in order)

### 1. HERO
Full-viewport. Navy background with a subtle baseball diamond SVG pattern overlay.

Content:
- Eyebrow: "2026 Season Campaign Proposal · moomoo × New York Mets"

---

### 2. THE OPPORTUNITY (The Brief)
White background. Sets up the strategic context before the campaign ideas.

**Sub-section A: What's Already Working**
3 stat cards summarizing the existing partnership:
- 38,603 — Average Citi Field attendance per game
- $56,397 — Average Mets fan household income (35% above NYC avg)
- 3M+ — Annual Mets fan touchpoints across 80 home games
- 25M — moomoo global users; the Mets deal is the NYC growth engine

**Sub-section B: The Gap**
A 2-column layout with "Current State" vs "2026 Opportunity":
- Current: Awareness (Moomoo Mondays, scoreboard signage, Win Fund)
- Opportunity: Conversion (fans who recognize the brand → fans who open an account)

**Sub-section C: The Core Insight**
A highlighted pull quote / insight card:
> "Baseball already teaches the fundamentals of investing — risk vs. reward,
> long-term patience, reading the data. moomoo's job is to make that connection
> feel obvious. Every at-bat is a trade. Every season is a portfolio."

---

### 3. THE STRATEGY (Three Pillars)
Gray background. Three large pillar cards, each with an icon, name, and
one-sentence description.

**Pillar 1: "Swing Trade"** — Digital & Social
Turn baseball stats into investing education. Create content that bridges
the two worlds, making moomoo feel native to the Mets conversation.

**Pillar 2: "Close the Deal"** — Citi Field Activations
Upgrade the in-stadium experience from passive signage to active conversion —
interactive touchpoints that give fans a reason to open the app before they
leave the park.

**Pillar 3: "The Mets Portfolio"** — Community & Influencer
Build a community of "fan-investors" through an influencer-driven content
series that rewards both fandom and financial engagement.

---

### 4. CAMPAIGN CONCEPTS (Three specific campaigns)

#### Campaign 1: "Swing Trade" (Social Series)

**The Idea:**
A weekly short-form social content series — Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts —
that maps Mets game moments to investing concepts.

Examples:
- Edwin Diaz's save percentage → Win rate / trade success rate
- A lineup card → A diversified portfolio
- Batting average → Average return rate
- Extra innings → Holding a position through volatility

**Content Calendar Snapshot (2-week sample):**
| Day | Platform | Content |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Monday | Instagram/TikTok | "Mets Monday Market Update" — last week's Mets stats mapped to market moves |
| Wednesday | X/Twitter | Quick-hit stat comparison: "Diaz: 91% save pct. Top moomoo traders: X% win rate." |
| Friday | YouTube Shorts | "Pre-game Playbook" — 60-sec investing tip themed around that night's matchup |
| Game Day | Instagram Stories | Live interactive poll: "Who wins tonight — or do your stocks?" |

**Influencer Tier:**
- Tier 1 (Finance creators, 500k+): Script-driven content using moomoo data
- Tier 2 (Mets fan accounts, 50k-500k): Game-day co-branded posts
- Tier 3 (NYC lifestyle micro, 10k-50k): Citi Field experience content + moomoo sign-up link

---

#### Campaign 2: "Close the Deal" (Citi Field Activation)

**The Idea:**
Transform the in-stadium moomoo presence from signage into a conversion engine.
Three new touchpoints layered onto the existing 36-ft display and suite access:

**Touchpoint A: The moomoo Trading Desk**
A staffed activation space (think: Red Bull sampling table, but for investing).
Located near Section 109 (the right-field promenade, highest foot traffic).
- Fan scans QR code → opens moomoo app → gets a Mets-themed "Opening Day Portfolio"
  (a curated watchlist of companies connected to baseball/NYC)
- First 200 fans to sign up each game get entered into the Win Fund drawing

**Touchpoint B: "Pitch Count = Trade Count" Digital Integration**
Work with the Citi Field scoreboard team to add a moomoo data overlay:
- After each half-inning: "[Pitcher Name]'s pitch count today: X. moomoo users made
  [Y] trades in the last 30 minutes. Are you in the game?"
- Gamifies the real-time trading angle and reinforces the app's live-data positioning

**Touchpoint C: Moomoo Monday Upgrade**
Existing: 500 free tickets for moomoo users.
2026 upgrade: Create a "Moomoo Monday Market" pre-game experience (90 min before
first pitch) — exclusive section with a financial wellness event, Mets player appearance,
and live moomoo portfolio challenge. Shareable, social-native, drives FOMO for non-users.

---

#### Campaign 3: "The Mets Portfolio" (Community Campaign)

**The Idea:**
A season-long community program where moomoo users build a virtual
"Mets Portfolio" — a watchlist of stocks tied to Mets sponsors, NYC companies,
and baseball industry leaders.

- Launch date: Opening Day 2026
- Each week: One new stock added to the "Mets Portfolio" watchlist, tied to a game
  moment or sponsor activation
- Season-end: User whose Mets Portfolio performed best wins a premium experience
  (Mets suite, meet-and-greet, moomoo merchandise)

**Why it works:**
- Gives fans a reason to open the app every week of the season
- Creates 162-game retention loop (not just a one-time sign-up)
- Generates UGC: fans share their portfolio performance like they share standings
- Connects moomoo's core product (a trading/watchlist platform) to the Mets universe

---

### 5. CONTENT & INFLUENCER STRATEGY

Two-column layout:

**Content Pillars (left):**
Three pillars with content examples under each:
1. **Educate** — Make investing approachable through baseball analogies
2. **Entertain** — Game-day moments, fan energy, behind-the-scenes
3. **Engage** — Challenges, polls, user-generated "portfolio" posts

**Influencer Framework (right):**
A tiered pyramid visual:
- Top (Macro, 500k+): 2-3 finance/investing creators for credibility and reach
- Middle (Mid-tier, 50k-500k): Mets fan accounts and NYC sports creators for community
- Bottom (Micro, 10k-50k): Authentic fan voices for conversion and UGC

---

### 6. MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK

Dark navy background. A "Campaign Scorecard" layout with 6 KPI cards.

| KPI | What It Measures | Why It Matters for moomoo |
|-----|-----------------|--------------------------|
| App Downloads | Direct response to Citi Field + social campaigns | Primary acquisition metric |
| New Account Openings | Mets fan → moomoo user conversion rate | Revenue driver |
| Moomoo Monday Attendance | Fan engagement with existing program | Retention / loyalty signal |
| Social Engagement Rate | Content resonance across platforms | Brand health metric |
| Influencer Earned Media Value | ROI on influencer spend | Efficiency benchmark |
| Win Fund Participation | App engagement tied to game outcomes | Retention / gamification metric |

Plus a simple "reporting cadence" note:
- Weekly: Social metrics + Win Fund tracking
- Monthly: Account openings + app engagement
- Seasonal: Full campaign impact report (the kind Griffin built at Wasserman)

---

### 7. WHY GRIFFIN (Credentials Section)

NOT a resume. A confident, first-person narrative section that connects
Griffin's specific experience to each of the three campaign pillars.

Layout: 3 credential cards, one per strategic pillar.

**Card 1 → "Swing Trade" pillar:**
"At Lucra Sports I launched the first NFL newsletter of the 2023 season —
content strategy, Figma graphics, distribution. At Michigan Sport Consulting
I led social growth strategy for NFL and NBA clients. I know how to make
sports content that converts."

**Card 2 → "Close the Deal" pillar:**
"At USA Hockey I executed 10+ in-person sponsorship activations at live events.
At Team Playmaker, I built the CRM and pitch framework that helped land Sporting
Kansas City's front-of-kit deal for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I understand how
brand moments become business outcomes."

**Card 3 → "The Mets Portfolio" pillar:**
"At Wasserman I built cross-channel sponsorship reports for the NY Islanders,
Goldman Sachs, Target, and NHL — measuring what actually moved the needle.
I know the difference between vanity metrics and real ROI."
